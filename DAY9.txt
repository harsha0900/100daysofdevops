Problem:
There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. The production support team identified 
that the application is unable to connect to the database. After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb 
service is down on the database server.

Look into the issue and fix the same

Solution:
step1: checked the status of the mariadb service once after SSH into the stratos dc.
>>> sudo systemctl status mariadb
step2: Noticed that mariadb server is down
step3: Trying to start the server
>> sudo systemctl start mariadb
step4: Noticed that it is not getting started, checked the logs using journalctl command
>> sudo jounrnalctl -xeu mariadb.service 
step5: observed that mariadb is not able to create required file in some folder, so provided the required 
permissons for mariadb.service to access that folder/directory. 
step6: Started the mariadb service.
step7: checked the status to ensure it is running and active.
