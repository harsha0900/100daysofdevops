Problem: 
Your task is to disable direct SSH root login on all app servers within the Stratos Datacenter.

Solution:
step1:Login to each app server and change the PermitRootLogin as no in file /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
step2:Restart ssh service (sudo systemctl restart sshd)

* changes will apply only after restart

The file /etc/ssh/sshd_config is the main configuration file for the SSH server daemon (sshd) on Linux/Unix systems.
