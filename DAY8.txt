Problem: 
Install ansible version 4.9.0 on Jump host using pip3 only. 
Make sure Ansible binary is available globally on this system, i.e all users on this system are able to run Ansible commands.

Solution:
Since ours is centos machine, use yum instead of apt.

Step 1: Install pip3 (if not installed)
sudo yum install python3-pip -y

Step 2: Install Ansible 4.9.0 using pip3 (system-wide)
sudo pip3 install ansible==4.9.0

Step 3: Verify installation
ansible --version
