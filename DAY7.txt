Problem: 
Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

Solution:
generate the public key in jump host and copy the public key to app servers, so that password less athentication is enabled.

step1:
Generate SSH key on the Jump Host (as thor)
>> ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

{ssh-keygen => this will generate the key}
{-t rsa => type of key mostly we use rsa}
{-b 4096 => size in bits, use 4096 than 2048 in prod to ensure security.

this generates the keys in /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa and /home/thor/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

step2: copy the key to appservers 
>> ssh-copy-id user@appserver

👉 ssh-copy-id copies your public key to a remote server so that you can SSH without a password.
